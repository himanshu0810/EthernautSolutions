# Solving GatekeeperThree: A Comprehensive Guide
In the GatekeeperThree challenge, we encounter a series of gates designed to test our understanding of Solidity and Ethereum smart contract interactions. Each gate presents a unique obstacle that we must overcome to progress further in the challenge. Let's delve into each gate in detail and discuss strategies for solving them.

## Gate One: Ownership Control
The first gate, gateOne, focuses on ownership control within the smart contract. It requires that the caller must be the owner of the contract and that the transaction origin is not the owner. This gate is implemented using a modifier in Solidity, which enforces these conditions before allowing the function execution to proceed.

## Strategy:
To bypass this gate, we need to set ourselves as the owner of the contract and ensure that the transaction origin is not recognized as the owner. We achieve this by executing the construct0r function, which is intentionally misspelled to resemble a constructor function. By calling this function, we effectively set our address as the owner of the contract. Additionally, we can circumvent the transaction origin check by sending the transaction from a smart contract instead of a regular Ethereum address.

## Gate Two: Password Validation
Gate Two, gateTwo, involves validating a password sent to another contract called SimpleTrick. The validation process in SimpleTrick checks if the provided password matches the one set at a particular timestamp. To pass this gate, we must ensure that the password check occurs within the same block where the password was last set, thus ensuring its validity.

## Strategy:
To tackle this gate, we need to interact with the SimpleTrick contract and provide the correct password for validation. We accomplish this by first deploying the SimpleTrick contract using the createTrick function. Subsequently, we call the getAllowance function with the current timestamp as the password. By doing so, we ensure that the password check happens within the same block, satisfying the requirements of the gate.

## Gate Three: Balance Transfer
The third gate, gateThree, involves transferring a small amount of Ether from the contract to the owner's address. However, this gate is susceptible to exploitation, as it does not properly handle the balance transfer and ownership control.

## Strategy:
To exploit this gate, we need to ensure that our solution contract receives a balance of at least 0.001 ETH during deployment. We achieve this by deploying the solution contract with the required initial balance. Then, we forward this balance to the gatekeeper contract, bypassing the attempted transfer to the owner. By executing these steps, we successfully exploit the vulnerability in gateThree.

## Solution Contract
To streamline the process and combine all necessary actions into a single solution, we create a solution contract that orchestrates the sequence of functions required to solve each gate. This solution contract executes the steps outlined above and ultimately enters the gatekeeper contract to complete the challenge.

### Conclusion
By understanding the intricacies of each gate and devising appropriate strategies to overcome them, we can successfully solve the GatekeeperThree challenge. Through careful planning, leveraging Solidity's functionalities, and exploiting vulnerabilities within the smart contracts, we demonstrate our proficiency in Ethereum development and smart contract security.
