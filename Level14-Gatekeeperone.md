# Gatekeeper One Exploit Walkthrough

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for exploiting the GatekeeperOne contract. We'll delve into the details of each modifier (`gateOne`, `gateTwo`, and `gateThree`) and outline specific strategies to bypass them in order to successfully invoke the `enter` function and set the `entrant` variable to `tx.origin`.

## GatekeeperOne Contract Overview

The GatekeeperOne contract features three modifiers, each imposing distinct conditions on callers aiming to access the `enter` function. Let's examine each modifier and devise strategies to circumvent their respective checks.

### GateOne Modifier

#### Condition:

    ```solidity
    require(msg.sender != tx.origin);

Strategy:
The condition checks whether the immediate caller (msg.sender) is the original sender (tx.origin). To bypass this, we can employ a proxy contract approach. We'll deploy two contracts where the first contract calls the second one, effectively masking the original sender. This setup ensures that msg.sender will not match tx.origin, allowing us to pass the gate.

GateTwo Modifier
Condition:

    ```solidity
    require(gasleft() % 8191 == 0);

Strategy:
The modifier checks if the remaining gas after the execution is a multiple of 8191. To determine the exact gas required, we need to employ a brute force approach. We'll iteratively increase the gas supplied until we find a value that satisfies the condition. By incrementing the gas in each function call within a reasonable range, we can ensure compliance with the gate's requirement.

GateThree Modifier
Conditions:

require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint64(_gateKey)));
require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) != uint64(_gateKey));
require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint160(tx.origin)));

We'll deploy two contracts where the first contract calls the second one, effectively masking the original sender.

### GateThree Modifier
Conditions:

    ```solidity
    require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint64(_gateKey)));
    require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) != uint64(_gateKey));
    require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint160(tx.origin)));
    
## Strategy:
The gate consists of three conditions involving bitwise operations on the _gateKey parameter and tx.origin. We'll break down each condition and devise a suitable _gateKey to satisfy them:

Ensure the first 16 bits of _gateKey match the second 32 bits, ensuring compliance with the first condition.
Guarantee that the first 32 bits of _gateKey do not match the entire 64 bits, fulfilling the second condition.
Construct _gateKey to match the first 32 bits with the last 16 bits of tx.origin, thus satisfying the third condition.
Exploit Implementation
To implement the exploit, we'll create a contract (LetMeThrough) that incorporates the aforementioned strategies for each gatekeeper modifier. By carefully orchestrating function calls and parameter constructions, we can successfully bypass all gatekeeper checks and invoke the enter function.

## Conclusion
Through meticulous analysis and strategic exploitation of each gatekeeper modifier, we've demonstrated how to effectively bypass security measures in the GatekeeperOne contract. This walkthrough underscores the importance of understanding contract logic and employing innovative solutions to achieve exploit success.
